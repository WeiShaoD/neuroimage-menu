Running fMRI with python
========================

This chapter we are going to have more fun as we can get rid of the neuroimage tool and use python to run the fMRI analysis

HCP dataset and Gamblining project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

HCP
***

The Human Connectome Project (HCP) is a data sharing initiative to address fundamental questions about human anatomy and variation related to neuron 
connectivity. It is based at Washington University and includes collaborations between University of Southern California, Harvard and Massachusetts General 
Hospital.The HCP collected scanned the brains of more than 1200 young men and women, mostly in their 20s, participants also completed questionnaires about 
their health and lives, an aerobic fitness walking test and cognitive tests.

The HCP dataset comprises task-based fMRI from a large sample of human subjects. The dataset includes time series data that has been preprocessed and 
spatially-downsampled by aggregating within 360 regions of interest. In order to use this dataset, please electronically sign the HCP data use terms at 
`ConnectomeDB <https://db.humanconnectome.org/app/template/Login.vm>`__. Although We are only use the gambling sub dataset for this chapter, you can apply 
the code with different dataset once you learned the code.
 
Instructions for this dataset are on pp. 24-25,36 and 50-51 of the `HcP Reference Manual 
<https://www.humanconnectome.org/storage/app/media/documentation/s1200/HCP_S1200_Release_Reference_Manual.pdf>`__. you are more than welcome to study this 
manual before the analysis
