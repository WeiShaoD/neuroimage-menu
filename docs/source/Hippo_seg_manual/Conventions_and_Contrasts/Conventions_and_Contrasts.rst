Conventions_and_Contrasts
=========================

ORDER OF TRACING
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Draw one ROI in all slices at a time for one hemisphere of the MTL, after you understand the lay of the land (see Getting Started with Segmentation). Move 
to the other hemisphere only after you have completed all ROIs in the first side. If you are only segmenting hippocampal subfields, then you can skip the 
PRC and ERC steps to proceed right to the hippocampal head. Otherwise, for the whole MTL, we recommend the following order per hemisphere:


NAMING CONVENTIONS AND LABELS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Naming conventions should include the prefix L- or R- for the hemisphere. If you have more than one segmenter or rater per subject, make sure that these 
labels and colour values are consistent. See the table below for our recommended labels::

  REGION OF INTEREST               LABEL     COLOUR     HEX
  Perirhinal Cortex                 PRC       Pink    #f791d8
