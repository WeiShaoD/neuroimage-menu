8 Variability in Landmarks
==========================

Rhinal Sulcus:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Variability in the depth of the rhinal sulcus (RS) within anterior slices of the temporal lobes has been noted previously (Hanke, 1997; Xie et al., 2017). 
However, most investigations into the structure of the perirhinal cortex (PRC, i.e., Brodmann areas 35 and 36) either do not describe slices before the 
appearance of the hippocampal head (Insausti et al., 1998; Taylor & Probst, 2008), do not distinguish the RS from the CS (Bonisha et al., 2004), or do not 
encounter any brains with significant variation of the RS before the appearance of the entorhinal cortex (Augistinack et al., 2013).

Ding and colleagues (2009) found that when a deep RS exists, anatomical area 35 is primarily found in the fundus and the lateral/anterior bank of the RS. 
In a follow-up study, Ding & Van Hoesen (2010) note that in brains with a deep RS which merges with the CS in anterior slices, area 35 is located in the 
medial bank of the CS, and area 36 occupies the fundus and lateral bank of the anterior CS.

**From these findings reported in Ding and colleagues (2009; 2010) we recommend the following for segmenting early anterior PRC slices:**

If a visible (deep) rhinal sulcus is present in early anterior slices such that it interrupts the extension of the PRC up to the Gyrus of Schwalbe from the 
CS, use the bifurcation rules. That is, when tracing the PRC before the limen insulae you should consider the rhinal sulcus and collateral sulcus as a 
double sulcus. Draw from the superior border of the Gyrus of Schwalbe to the fundus of the more lateral sulcus (i.e., CS).
