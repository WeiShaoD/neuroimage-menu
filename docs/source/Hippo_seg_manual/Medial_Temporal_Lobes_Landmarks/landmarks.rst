4 Lay of the land: medial temporal lobes landmarks 
==================================================

With your segmentation notes spreadsheet open in a separate window, start by identifying the landmarks outlined in the following section. This process will 
allow you to get a “feel” for your particular subject's anatomy before you actually start segmenting. You will make notes about these landmarks and which 
slice you identify them in your spreadsheet. It is recommended that you move in an anterior-posterior direction when identifying these landmarks.  It is 
critical that you follow the order outlined in this section, as certain earlier decisions on landmarks will inform later ones. Screenshots with examples 
are included to help you. Please note, however, that you will need to read the rules for each landmark carefully as your T2 images will certainly vary 
greatly (see **Variability in Landmarks** for more information).

LANDMARK 1: FIRST SLICE CONTAINING THE COLLATERAL SULCUS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The first slice of the MTL is the first slice in your image set where you can clearly see grey matter ribbon only consists of the perirhinal cortex. The 
depth of the CS determines $ important to identify the CS first. In your spreadsheet, note down the first and most ante$ example below.

LANDMARK 3: THE FIRST SLICE CONTAINING VISIBLE HIPPOCAMPAL HEAD
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Next, you will need to look for the hippocampal head. To find this landmark::

 A In its first appearance, the hippocampal head will probably look like a “bean” shape
 B The amygdala is located superior and the ventricle is lateral to the hippocampal head
 C Ambient gyrus appears in the same slice as the appearance of the hippocampal head
