4 LAY OF THE LAND: MEDIAL TEMPORAL LOBES LANDMARKS
==================================================

With your segmentation notes spreadsheet open in a separate window, start by identifying the landmarks outlined in the following section. This process will
allow you to get a “feel” for your particular subject's anatomy before you actually start segmenting. You will make notes about these landmarks and which
slice you identify them in your spreadsheet. It is recommended that you move in an anterior-posterior direction when identifying these landmarks.  It is
critical that you follow the order outlined in this section, as certain earlier decisions on landmarks will inform later ones. Screenshots with examples
are included to help you. Please note, however, that you will need to read the rules for each landmark carefully as your T2 images will certainly vary
greatly (see **Variability in Landmarks** for more information).
