GETTING STARTED WITH SEGMENTATION
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this section, we will start off by surveying the goals of medial temporal lobe segmentation and introducing the necessary tools for manual segmentation.

GOALS OF SEGMENTATION
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The medial temporal lobes (MTL) are composed of several regions of interest (ROI) for perception and memory research, including the rhinal cortex, 
hippocampus, and parahippocampal cortex. To understand the relationship between grey matter volume in these MTL regions and specific cognitive processes, 
we need to determine the boundaries of these regions. This is achieved through the manual segmentation, or tracing, of MTL regions. Here, we will introduce 
segmentation based on the Olsen-Amaral-Palombo (OAP) protocol.

TOOLS REQUIRED FOR SEGMENTATION
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

ITK-SNAP (Yushkevich et al., 2006) is used as the primary segmentation software in this guide. We use version 3.8.0 in this guide (download link `here
