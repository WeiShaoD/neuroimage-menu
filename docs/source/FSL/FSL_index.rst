The goal of this chapter is to show you how to run fMRI analysis with FSL step by step. After successfully install FSL and set up, we are going to 
analyze a$ first-hand experiences. The data is Ballon Analogue Risk Task. I hope after this chapter, you will be able to apply the knowledge of FSL 
in the future and p$

We will start with the dataset downloading, preprocessing and end with 3rd level analysis as follow:
