Random forest 
=============

According to Wikipedia, Random forests is an ensemble learning method for classification, regression and other tasks that operates by constructing a multitude 
of decision trees from training data. For classification tasks, the prediction of the random forest is the class selected by most trees. Random decision forests 
correct for decision trees' habit of overfitting to their training set. In general, although the data characteristics may affect the performance RF, Random 
forests outperform decision trees. More more information, please see this `Random forest <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ>`__.
