According to Wikipedia, Multilayer perceptron (MLP) is a kind of feedforward deep neural network where is become very popular in recent years.There are 
three layers of MLP: an input layer, a hidden layer and an output layer. MLP utilizes a supervised learning technique called **backpropagation** for 
training.Its multiple layers and non-linear activation distinguish MLP from a linear perceptron. It can distinguish data that is not linearly separable.
